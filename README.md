This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) web app for collaborative evaluation within an organization. It allows admins to create evaluation forms (evals) that users can fill out to evaluate themselves and their peers. The app provides a dashboard for both admins and users to view and analyze results.

## Description

- Web app where admins can create new evals (an eval is a form containing a set of questions that users fill out, each question has a response in the form of a rating from 1 to 5)
- Users must take these evals, and they must also evaluate other peers
- Admins can view the results of all evals

### Evals dashboard (Admin-only)

- Admins can view results of all evals
- Admins can make a new eval from scratch
  - Admin punches in the description
  - Admin punches in what the questions are
  - Admin can set the due date for when users have to fill out the eval
- Click on a new eval -> takes you to eval dashboard
  - % of people who have taken it already
  - View list of users
    - Click on any one of the users to view their results
    - Full dashboard of results (both self-eval and peer-eval) for that user, complete with charts

### My Evals page

- Users can view the evals they have not taken yet where deadline has not passed
  - Users can click on any evals they have not taken yet and fill it out
  - Evals can require the user to full out a self-eval plus any number of manager, peer, or subordinate evals

### Analyze Evals Page (Admin-only)

- Admins can view the results of all evals, for each target user, by each evaluator user.
- This allows a comprehensive 360-degree view of the eval results.

## Getting Started

Ensure you have node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

First, navigate to the main project folder `eval_project` and install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, create a new database:

```bash
npx prisma db push
```

This command will create a new SQLite database file in the `prisma` folder.
Lastly, start the development server in the terminal by running

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Note that after signing in, youi'll have to navigate to the Evals page to create your new account in the database. In a real production app, this will be done automatically via webhook after signing in.

By default, everyone is an Admin (for testing purposes). You can change this by modifying the `isAdmin` field in the database to default to `false` for new users. Then, you can manually set a given user's `isAdmin` field to `true` with the make_user_admin.py Python script in the `scripts` folder.
